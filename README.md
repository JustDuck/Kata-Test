# Kata-Test
For Russ Wangler CTO 7Signal  
I revised and added two branches.  
These are for the two packages:  package kataTestR1.java; and package kataTestR1.test;
The original is the same as before.
In kataTestR1.java, there are 9 java class files which I cleaned up.
In kataTestR1.test, there are 11 files, nine of which are junit tests and two are for a JunitTestSuite.
The test runner can be run either as an application or via junit test.
